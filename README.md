# Drug Approval Prediction
Machine learning project predicting drug approval outcomes based on clinical trial data

-Summary :
This project addressed the challenge of predicting drug approval status based on clinical trial and drug-related features. The goal was to build a reliable machine learning model that could assist in early-stage decision-making for pharmaceutical research, reducing the time and cost associated with late-stage drug failures.

Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, we developed a system capable of classifying drugs as Approved or Not Approved with strong accuracy. This work demonstrates how machine learning can provide actionable insights to R&D and regulatory teams, ultimately supporting more efficient resource allocation and faster drug development pipelines.

## Files
- `drug_approval_prediction_dataset.csv` — dataset used for model training
- `drug_approval_prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model training

## How to Run
1. Download both files.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are installed.
4. Run all cells.

## Model
Final model achieved high accuracy using Random Forest Classifier.
